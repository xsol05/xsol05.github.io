This year, I set a few [goals](https://magdelinehuang.com/posts/013-tech-goals-for-2025/) for myself, one of which was learning 3D.

As I mentioned in my previous post, I've never worked with 3D before but always thought it was cool to be able to build something 3D and even have it printed. Sprinkling 3D elements into a website would also be interesting.

For my software, I decided to use [Spline](https://spline.design/). Spline is a web-based 3D design tool where you can build, animate, and publish interactive 3D experiences. I chose it because:

- It's fun, fast, and very beginner-friendly
- The UI feels familiar - kinda like Figma but for 3D
- I didn't need to download anything because it runs in-browser

Overall, it ticked a lot of my boxes as a tool to dip my toes into 3D.

Here are the 3D projects I worked on and details of my process, including the struggles I faced.

I also got to try 3D printing!

Overall, this venture into the world of 3D was incredibly insightful.

There was a lot of clicking and mouse-moving needed for creating the 3D models, something I now appreciate does not exist in the world of coding haha ü§£ Designing in 3D is also kinda hard with the added dimension. The model might look alright from one angle, but when you look at the model from a different perspective, you might see it's actually not all that alright haha.

3D printing was also really fun! I'm inspired to start using my library's 3D printing machine and print out some aesthetic and practical items!
