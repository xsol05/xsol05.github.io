As a software engineer who spends my 9 - 5 coding SaaS products, this year I want to create a ‚ú® creative portfolio ‚ú®

If something sparks my curiosity, I will pursue it as a project. Here are some areas I want to explore:

- 3D modelling on Spline
- Data storytelling / data visualisation
- Coding a cozy game
- AI
- Animation

Some other goals are to sharpen my React, JavaScript, and CSS skills and read ‚ÄúThe Coding Career Handbook‚Äù by [Shawn Swyx Wang](https://www.swyx.io/).

Not all these areas involve code, and that's the beauty of it.

My motto is to explore whatever catches your curiosity. If it‚Äôs not for you, move on. But if it is, you might have just uncovered a new opportunity!

And most importantly, have fun! üòÄ

What are your goals for 2025? Share them below!

PS This was originally an Instagram post on @magdelinehuang but it makes for a good 2025 opener blog post too! And yes, I'm trying to create more content this year!
